## Analysis Carried Out

1. Use simple feature elimination for comparison - Percentile based selection
2. Use a non forward feature elimination technique - Recursive elimination with cross validation
3. Use an implicit feature selection technique - Extra Trees
4. Experiment with a feature selecting ensemble classifier - Random Forest
5. Experiment with a simple classifer - LDA
6. Experiment with a classifier that performs well with non linear data - QDA
7. Experiment with a classifier that is consistent and fast - Gaussian NB

### Finidngs
1. Despite each of the the feature slection techniques adopting radically different methods to select features the classifiers still perform no better than chance
2. Existing knowledge about SPECT scans cannot be corroborated
