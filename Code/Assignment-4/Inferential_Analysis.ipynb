We considered comparing people with only brain trauma, which had a larger sample size (36 samples), but decided to use anxiety disorders as group B because we do not know what part of the brain was affected during the trauma, and thus what delta values would be affected from the disorder or the trauma itself. We do know that people with anxiety disorders have abnormal blood flow in the basal ganglia (http://www.amenclinics.com/the-science/spect-gallery/anxiety/), which is responsible for movement and coordination, just as is the cerebellum. Because the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test is more robust, it is less likely to falsely report significance than would be the t-test. Thus, we can be fairly certain our results reflect a true difference in delta values for healthy people and those with anxiety disorders."
